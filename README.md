# **Gen Merch Flat Files Process Automation**

## 📄 Overview

As part of legacy GM offerings, Circana delivers approximately **130+ weekly and monthly frequencies** to its clients. 

The current process involves **multiple hand-offs and manual interventions**, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. Frequencies are delivered using **Circana proprietary tools** such as **ETL Job Control, Edit Manager, etc.**

## 🧭 Solution Objective

### **Core Workflow**
1.  **Job Initiation:**
    *   **User Submission:** A user submits a job via a **streamlit Web Form**.
    *   **Data Storage:** The job details are stored in a **Jobs** database.
    *   **Notification:** Simultaneously, a message is sent to **Power Automate**, which alerts a **Teams Channel** about the new submission.

2.  **Job Processing & Control:**
    *   **Python App Engine:** A central **Python App** acts as the orchestrator. it "Searches and Starts Jobs" by pulling from the database and updates job statuses as they progress.
    *   **Backend Support:** The app interacts with **GOATS** to enable event-driven triggers.

3.  **NAV Integration (The Execution Pipeline):**
    The Python App manages jobs through a series of RPA's (numbered steps 2 through 6) across various NAV components:
    *   **Edit Manager & Console:** The app interacts with the **NAV Edit Manager** (to define job rules and schedule times) and the **NAV Console**.
    *   **Validation:** The system performs automated checks, such as "Verify for 'No Data Found'" and "Verify for 'No Issues' for each hierarchy."
    *   **ETL & Execution:** The job reaches the **NAV Element Centre** and **NAV ETL Job Control**, where data input for job submission occurs.

4.  **Scheduling & Reporting:**
    *   **Schedule Management:** Based on validation results, the system can **Re/Schedule** jobs.
    *   **Final Actions:** Once a job is scheduled, the system updates the **Felix** power-app and updates the final "closeout" status.
    *   **Status Updates:** **Email Updates** are sent throughout the process, and final statuses are fed back to Power Automate and the primary Jobs database to complete the loop.

## ⚙️ Development Environment

### GitHub Codespaces

Click **“Code → Open with Codespaces”** to launch the preconfigured environment.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run all tests before submitting for review:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Test coverage includes:

* DK connection validation
* Flat file schema conformity
* Delivery endpoint availability

---

## 🚀 Deployment / Delivery

Once validated, the automation will be scheduled or integrated into internal orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Control-M, or internal schedulers).
For the POC, execution will be manual via the CLI.
